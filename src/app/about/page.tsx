            <p>
              We are <b>Sagar Sahu</b> and <b>Sahil Singh</b>, two passionate final-year MCA postgraduates from Sarala Birla University. Our journey into building MindMash stems from a shared belief in the transformative power of technology — especially when it comes to education.<br /><br />

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              At MindMash, we believe that education should never be confined by cost, age, or access. Our mission is simple but powerful:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 my-4 italic text-primary">
              "To make learning easy, smooth, and free for all."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              We want to break the traditional boundaries of education — to create a space where learning is fun, adaptive, and open to everyone, regardless of background. Whether you're a student preparing for exams, a professional brushing up on skills, or a lifelong learner exploring new topics, MindMash aims to meet you where you are.<br /><br />
              Our platform is designed to remove friction and bring joy to the learning process, using the power of AI to personalize and simplify how knowledge is shared and tested.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">AI-Powered Quiz Generation</h2>
            <p>
              Gone are the days of spending hours creating quiz questions or relying on static, generic templates. With MindMash, we've reimagined the quiz-building experience using the capabilities of Generative AI.<br /><br />
              By integrating the <b>Gemini API</b>, our platform allows users to generate intelligent, topic-specific quizzes with just a few clicks. You can input a concept, subject, or even a block of content — and within seconds, the AI creates a structured, balanced set of quiz questions tailored to your input.<br /><br />
              Whether you're:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>a teacher looking to assess students creatively,</li>
              <li>a student wanting to self-evaluate before exams,</li>
              <li>or just someone hosting a friendly quiz night,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              ...MindMash ensures each quiz feels fresh, engaging, and customized.<br /><br />
              Our AI doesn't just generate questions — it crafts a learning experience. The questions are diverse in format (MCQs, true/false, etc.), well-paced in difficulty, and aligned with the topic's context. Plus, you can challenge friends using shareable links, making learning social and fun.
